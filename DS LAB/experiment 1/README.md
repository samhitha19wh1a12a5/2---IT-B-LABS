#AIM OF THE EXPERIMENT :Writing linear search program  by using non recursive functions.

##LINEAR SEARCH:This is to find whether a number is present in an array.If it is present,then what location it occurs..we will be comparing each element to search until we find it.

###STEP BY STEP PROCEDURE :

 First we will be taking an array of 10 elements and they are a[i]={12,61,33,92,36,3,29,98,54,60}.

 The first element position is considered as "i" which is "0"
and the last element position is "n" which is "9".

 Key numbers are 36,100.

 We will be using for loop here for(i=0;i<=n;i++)

 if the condition a[i]==key is true ,then the key element position is given as output as we are saying to print the position of key value.

 My key value is 36,and it compares from the first element until it gets 36.when it finds the key value it gives the output as "4".

 And the next condition is if key value is not present in the array
When i > n we will be printing that the element is not found in the array.

 As 100 is not there in my array the output shows as element is not found.

##OUTPUT :For key 36
![for key 36](output.png)

for key 100:
